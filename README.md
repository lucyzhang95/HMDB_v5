# Data parser for [Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)]("https://www.hmdb.ca/")

HMDB 5.0 increased annotated metabolite entries to 217,920 and unannotated derivatized metabolite entries for GC-MS to 1,581,537. <br>

The metabolite descriptions are generated, corrected, and expanded manually or semi-manually. <br>

According to the publication, 9,445,375 highly quality predicted spectral datasets and other experimental ‘observables’ have been added to the database including:
- 312,980 predicted 1H and 13C NMR spectra
- 1,752,677 more predicted GC–MS spectra
- 1,440,324 predicted LC–MS/MS spectra
- 5,067,714 predicted retention indices
- 871,680 predicted collision cross-section values
